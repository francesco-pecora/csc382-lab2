# CSC 382 - Analysis of Algorithms - Heap Sort

For each algorithm, and for each n = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 4000, 10000, measure its running time and number of steps when the input is (1) already sort, i.e. n, n-1, …, 3, 2,1; (2) reversely sorted 1, 2, 3, … n; (3) random permutation of 1, 2, …, n; (4) 50 instances of n random numbers generated in the range of [1..n].

Note:

(1) You may have to repeat the algorithm many times, each time you need to initialize the array.

(2) Your running time should exclude the time for initialization. 

(3) All measurement should be done in a single run, i.e. you do not need to run once for n=100, another time for n=200, etc

 

What to turn in:

(1) Well documented source code in C++

(2) Report the number of steps and the CPU running time in a table (Add this result in your previous table).

(3) Plot the running time of the algorithm results (Add this result in your previous plot).

(4) Approximation the constant c in the complexity of heap sort (cnlgn) by inspecting the results
